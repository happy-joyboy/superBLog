# About Me

👋 Hey there, I'm **Habi** — aka **JoyBoy**, your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity explorer.

I'm a cybersecurity student, security researcher, and self-taught enthusiast with a knack for dissecting systems and building robust solutions. My journey blends red team aggression with blue team resilience, fueled by a relentless curiosity to understand how things tick—whether it's code, networks, or hardware.

## 🔐 My Cybersecurity Journey

I’m obsessed with securing the digital world while mastering the art of ethical hacking. My focus spans:

- **🛡️ Red Teaming**: I dive deep into web app vulnerabilities, Android app weaknesses, and network exploitation. From SQL injection to XSS, I hunt for flaws with tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit.
- **🔍 Reverse Engineering**: I wield Jadx, Ghidra, and Binary Ninja to unravel Android APKs, analyzing bytecode and runtime behaviors to uncover hidden risks.
- **🧪 Security Education**: I lead workshops on Nmap and offensive security, mentoring students to become the next generation of cyber warriors.
- **🧰 CTF & Labs**: I craft vulnerable PHP web apps for hands-on practice, covering SQLi, XSS, IDOR, and more, to sharpen my skills and teach others.

## 📱 Software & Hardware Wizardry

Beyond cybersecurity, I’m a builder at heart, with a love for creating systems that are both functional and secure:

- **💾 Embedded Systems**: I tinker with PIC16F877A microcontrollers, writing firmware to bring hardware to life.
- **🤖 Android Development**: I build high-performance Android apps using Java and Cronet, focusing on secure file-sharing and runtime protections.
- **🌐 Full-Stack Web Development**: I create dynamic web experiences with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Python, integrating tools like Firebase for real-time features like likes, comments, and views.

## 🎮 Projects That Define Me

Here’s a glimpse of what I’ve been cooking in my digital lab:

- **🧠 MIPS Assembly Centipede**: Built a retro-style Centipede game in MIPS assembly using MARS, complete with collision detection, blaster mechanics, and entity logic.
- **🛰️ A* Pathfinding in MIPS**: Developed a pathfinding algorithm with a binary min-heap priority queue, proving efficiency in low-level programming.
- **⚙️ Secure File-Sharing System**: Created a Wi-Fi-based file-sharing app in Java, using TCP segmentation, OTP/QR authentication, and encryption for secure transfers.
- **🌐 Cybersecurity Blog**: Running a Hugo-powered blog with the Blowfish theme, documenting my journey with Arabic support, dynamic Firebase features (likes, comments, views), and a sleek, moving background.

## 🧠 Always Evolving

I’m constantly sharpening my skills and chasing new challenges:

- **🏆 Certifications**: Studying for eJPT and OSCP to solidify my expertise in penetration testing.
- **📚 Deep Dives**: Obsessed with Android Runtime (ART), mobile app hardening, secure coding, and bug bounty methodologies.
- **🛠️ Tools & Techniques**: Staying current with tools like Frida, Wireshark, and OWASP ZAP, and exploring advanced topics like kernel exploits and cloud security.

## 📸 Life Beyond the Terminal

When I’m not battling bugs or writing code, I’m out exploring the world:

- **🏃 Sunrise Runs**: Chasing the perfect orange sky with my camera, capturing nature’s beauty.
- **📖 Cyberpunk Vibes**: Devouring novels like *1984* and *Neuromancer* for inspiration.
- **🎨 Creative Coding**: Experimenting with animations and dynamic web features to bring my blog to life.
