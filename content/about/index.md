## 🔐 My Cybersecurity Journey

I’m obsessed with securing the digital world while mastering the art of ethical hacking. My focus spans:

- **🛡️ Red**: I dive deep into web app vulnerabilities, Android app weaknesses, and network exploitation.
- **🔍 Reverse Engineering**: I used Jadx, Ghidra, and Binary Ninja to unravel Android APKs, analyzing bytecode and runtime behaviors to uncover risks.
- **🧪 Security Education**: I lead workshops in msp team helping other with what i learned.
- **🧰 CTF & Labs**: Iam trying to craft vulnerable PHP web apps for hands-on practice, covering SQLi, XSS, IDOR, and more, to sharpen my skills and teach others.
